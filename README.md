The Kolam designs provide a fascinating area of study for their strong mathematical underpinnings.
Built a small project that combines computer vision with the art of Rangoli. The system analyzes hand-drawn Kolams by detecting grids, symmetry, loops, and complexity and recreates new patterns digitally.
Sharing some visuals of the pipeline + recreated Kolams below
